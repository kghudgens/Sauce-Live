        <p>No gimmicks, microwaves or heat lamps.  It's all original recipe and taste.  Cooked when you order - usually a 30-minute wait to prepare your meal.  For take-out orders, please call before you come. We specialize in mobile dinner trays, designed for your meal to look and taste the same whether you decide to dine-in or take it to go.
        </p>
        <p >This is a great place for couples, family and friends.  Sauce Live has been serving the military, local community and international tourists since 1992.
            We look forward to serving you.
